# Janus: Blockchain FaceID

Janus is a powerful and secure blockchain FaceID plugin, leveraging the power of zero-knowledge machine learning through the [ezkl](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl) library. Designed as a submission for the Scaling ETH hackathon, Janus provides an innovative solution for user authentication using a combination of their crypto wallet and a selfie.

### Features
- Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning: Janus utilizes the ezkl library to perform machine learning operations, such as model forwarding and mock proving, while preserving user privacy.
- Blockchain Integration: Seamlessly authenticate users with their cryptocurrency wallets, making Janus a perfect fit for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based platforms.
- Authenticate with Janus Button: Easily integrate Janus into your frontend application with our "Authenticate with Janus" button, providing a smooth and user-friendly authentication experience.
- Selfie-Based Authentication: Strengthen security and user experience by allowing users to authenticate themselves with a simple selfie, combining biometric data with blockchain technology.
